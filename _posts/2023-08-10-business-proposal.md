I'm going to assume that you guys have watched the kdrama, Business Proposal (사내맞선), because DISCLAIMER: LOTS OF SPOILERS. This kdrama was actually recommended to me by a woman who I have a crush on. Ok, onwards. The kdrama, George. Focus. The kdrama. 

### Plot Summary

The show is about a super perfect rich guy CEO with zero emotional intelligence who makes a deal with a super attractive woman (who he's apparently not interested in) to pretend to be his girlfriend. They both fall in love. The end.

Side note: for those who've watched What's Wrong with Secretary Kim (김비서가 왜 그럴까), you'll see some similar tropes and themes: office romance, achilles heel in the man, and corporate hot-guy mogul. 

But as in all romance and in life, it's all about the execution, and it's never about the plot itself. 

I have always said that there are two things that make a romance great:
* That the right people end up together (which doesn't happen in real life, given our miserable 40% divorce rate in the States)
* The scenes and details that show the two lovers becoming close (which includes lots of dialogue and interesting scenarios).

This is what elevates all romance films to greatness. So, which details did I find particularly compelling?

Firstly, Kim Sejeong's (Shin Ha-ri's) facial expressions. TO DIE FOR. SUCH GOOD ACTING. Her expressions of exasperation are some of the cutest most relatable things ever. For instance, there is one scene where Kang Tae-mu calls her at 4 am in the morning to spite her for calling him an archaeopteryx. And she just looks at the time with her wide eyes and thinks, "Holy cow, it's 4am. I'm totally awake now." Just the realism with how she reacts to every frustrating situation makes the drama such an enjoyable experience, because it makes it so easy for us to imagine the sheer frustration of being in such a weird situation. There are also several scenes where Kang Tae-mu asks her to repeatedly re-make the ravioli dish for a company project. Her expressions of utter frustration when she is asked to redo the same thing over and over again--just magical acting. Yet another scene shows Shin Ha-ri abandoned on the side of the road, in the rain, with Kang Tae-mu speeding away in his expensive sports car. You could feel the fumes coming out of her nostrils. And to wrap--let's be honest, Kim Sejeong has a really cute smile, and her facial expressions just carried this entire drama to another level.

Besides the superb acting, there were so many scenes that made you feel like you understood how Tae-mu and Ha-ri's love for each other grew. My favorite scene in the entire drama is Episode 3's fake date at the MeloMance concert. Ha-ri is given tickets to attend this concert by her long-time crush for her birthday present; her crush tells her to take a guy she's interested in. Lo and behold, she ends up getting roped into going with a reluctant Kang Tae-mu on a fake date. The scene, which involves the beautiful song, Love, Maybe (사랑인가 봐), by MeloMance, was tragic, heartbreaking, and also so lovely. Ha-ri sits there, crying, listening to this song, recollecting how she and her crush used to love this music together. Meanwhile, her fake date, Kang Tae-mu, is extremely stoic and doesn't know how to react, but politely sits there, handing her a handkerchief. I loved this scene because it felt like a turning point in the drama. You get a sense that Tae-mu empathizes with Ha-ri and doesn't just see her as a convenient business partner.

Dialogue from the scene:

Ha-ri: "That friend of mine got back together with his ex-girlfriend. I don't regret it though. I was really happy for those seven years. Someone like you who can't tolerate wasting time can't understand that, right?"
Tae-mu: "Well, it's not always that way. There are some things that get results with a short amount of time. And other things where you risk the losses and stay in it for the long run. It's difficult to decide how good or bad something is just by how long it takes."

I think a lot of guys, especially those that are career oriented, tend to view life as a thing to be optimized. You optimize your time with friends, optimize your time at work, optimize your time in school. You make sure that time with friends is filled with adrenaline and doing interesting things; if you're not particularly interested in being friends with someone, there's no need to be kind or polite at all. If you dislike your work, you do the minimum amount to not get fired. You do enough in classes just to eke by with a passing grade but do no further work unless you're really interested in that class. A lot of high achieving people I know treat life this way, and while it can be rewarding, sometimes it's soul crushing.

In relationships, the typical dating advice (for both men and women) is to have enough self-respect where if you're friendzoned, to completely end it. Because she's just not that into you, and you, my man, have value, and there are a thousand other fish in the sea that would love to be with you. You ought to optimize. But what Ha-ri speaks to is that experience of being willing to sacrifice some efficiency and some self-respect by continuing to pursue this otherwise irrational thing, love. Somehow in love, we're often willing to be completely burned, extremely vulnerable, because, to reference the song--we have this tiny hope that 'Love, Maybe'. The fact is that we've all been here, and many of us, like Ha-ri, can genuinely say something similar: "I don't regret it though. I was really happy."

In this scene, you also finally see Ha-ri empathizing with Tae-mu. When Kang Tae-mu and Ha-ri are outside of a (Korean equivalent of) 7/11, getting ice for the ball that hit Ha-ri's eye:

Ha-ri: "Could I maybe make a small suggestion?"
Tae-mu: "Sure. What is it?"
Ha-ri: "Instead of a fake relationship like this, why don't you try a real one? You might think it's a waste of time to be in a relationship right now, but if you think long-term, it might be more efficient. You know, you could even get married."
Tae-mu: "Married?"
Ha-ri: "Yes, being in a fake relationship with me means there really isn't a future. So maybe this is an even bigger waste of time."

The way she offered the suggestion was so gentle, as if to show that finally, Ha-ri is saying to herself, "Let me see things from his perspective. Let me try to understand where he's coming from, and help him solve his problem."

### Other Amazing Scenes

There are so many other amazing scenes in this drama that I can't list them all here. But here are two of my favorites:

* Kang Tae-mu stalks Ha-ri's Instagram and takes her to all the restaurants that she wanted to go to. This was such a great part of the drama. You could see the pure joy on Ha-ri's face when she went to the hamburger stand. I don't know about you, but when you love someone, you derive so much happiness from watching the person you love be super happy. And this scene just was it. It doesn't get better than this, folks.

* The rain date. Tae-mu is deathly afraid of rain, because it reminds him of the day he lost his parents. Ha-ri and Tae-mu have a date planned, but after Ha-ri finds out that it's raining, she takes Tae-mu through the subway, buys flowers, and blocks his view when he's eating so that he doesn't have to see rain. Guys, this was just so sweet and lovely, I can't contain my joy. The scene ends where Tae-mu is at a loss for words, and Ha-ri just embraces him and pats his back. Wow. I'm sobbing. And if you want to rewatch it. Voila, here's a [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGYQRMLHZ1w).

### Other relatable parts

The development of the relationship between Tae-mu and Ha-ri alone makes this kdrama one of the best, in my eyes. But what made it super relatable, at least from the guy perspective were the following:

* That guy that the girl loves instead of you. And he's a chef guy that can cook. Ok, guys, let's be real, there's ALWAYS THAT GUY. And it's the worst when you realize that in a different world, you and that guy would probably be great friends. Firstly, because you trust that the woman that you're interested in has a good judgement in men (except if she rejected you, in which case, uh, she's got some bad judgement in men). But secondly--ok, if the guy cooks awesome food--ahem--who wouldn't be his friend?

* Cha Sung-hoon prioritizing reason above his heart. This broke my heart to watch. Kang Tae-mu's secretary is so loyal to Kang Tae-mu Mu that he doesn't pursue the woman he's interested in, and continues to rebuff her advances. He draws explicit boundaries and ignores her when she greets him, because he knows that she wronged Tae-mu, justifying to himself that it would complicate relations at the company if they were together. We've all been there, where there are two demons talking to us, our rational logical side, and our emotional irrational side. And at least for me, while I love to fantasize about romance, in 9 of 10 cases in real life, I will bite the bullet and let the rational logical side win, so this hit home. 

* Rich people being simultaneously friends with people that are hopelessly low income. Haha, this felt so real. I am now in that age group where many of my friends have quite a stable income stream, and are making orders of magnitude more than me, and somehow are willing to hang out with me in my dingy life. Too real, director--stop spying on my life!

* The long distance. So relatable and I wish more romance films these days dealt with this subject. Long distance is increasingly common, and figuring out how to navigate the constant zoom calls, phone calls, and misunderstandings is really really tough. I was glad they paid homage to this mammoth in the modern dating and relationship landscape, if even ever so briefly.

* Ok, THE FOOD. I was salivating every time they zoomed in on the pastries and savory kitchen masterpieces. In episode 9, Kang Tae-mu takes Ha-ri to an empty restaurant and cooks for her. The camera zooms in on his hands, which are expertly preparing the food and cutting onions. Wow. Chef's kiss~~ As someone who sucks at cooking, this show made me want to improve my cooking skills, if only to be able to impress the ladies.

### Things That Felt Off

And by "off", I mean that they just made me feel weird. Not that I didn't enjoy them, but rather that it temporarily reminded me that I was watching a TV show, not experiencing it in real life.

* Kang Tae-mu is deathly afraid of rain. Um, ok, I thought this was a nice touch because it allowed for very interesting scenes in the film where he, for example, drops her on the side of the road, or where she helps guide him through the trauma of being in the rain. But I actually googled how often it rains in Seoul: literally 112/365 days ~ every 3 days...

* Ha-ri had a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip4. OK PEOPLE, HOW DOES SHE HAVE A $1000 PHONE when she's in constant debt?

* Every time the kdrama shows the TV show with Shin Geum-mi at the chicken store. So, if you haven't watched the show, basically, this is a show within the show. The grandfather of Kang Tae-mu watches this drama, and the drama's plot is almost exactly that of the kdrama itself. I think the intention of this was to make it feel like Inception--a show within a show, a mis en abyme. But it's unnecessary. We're not really watching this show to think deeply. We're here to watch other people fall in love, because sometimes that can be almost as good as falling in love ourselves.

### Fin

But ok, besides these small gripes, this KDRAMA WAS SO GOOD!!! If you read this far, either you cheated and skipped to the ending, or maybe I'm truly magnificent at writing reviews (I'm kidding). If you haven't watched it yet, what are you waiting for? Go watch it now! And if you have watched it already, let me know what you think...
